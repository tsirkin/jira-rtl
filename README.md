# jira-rtl

JiraRTL is a chrome extension that enables well aligned and properly established direction of rtl text in Jira.  
You can report bugs & requests using this repository.  
I will be glad to fix any bugs and add features when I have time for this.  
The extension is free and probably will remain free, enjoy.
